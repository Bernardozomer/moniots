services:
  # Aliases.
  ## Used for services that are insecure by default, and their standard port is a common target.
  - &insecure_on_default_port
    note: This protocol/version is insecure. Its default port is well-known and frequently scanned by attackers.

  ## Used for services that are insecure by default, running on a non-standard port.
  - &insecure_on_other_port
    port: -1 # Represents any non-default port for this service.
    note: This protocol/version is insecure. Running on a non-default port offers minor obscurity but does not fix underlying security issues.

  ## Used for secure services whose default port is often targeted, and changing it is a common hardening recommendation.
  - &secure_on_default_port_change_recommended
    note: This protocol is secure, but its default port is heavily targeted.

  # Services.
  ## Secure services where changing the default port is often recommended.
  - name: ssh
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: Secure Shell. Encrypted remote login, file transfer (SFTP), and tunneling.
    remediation: This protocol is secure, but consider changing the default port as part of a defense-in-depth strategy.
    ports:
      - <<: *secure_on_default_port_change_recommended
        port: 22

  ## Inherently insecure services.
  - name: telnet
    severity: CRITICAL
    description: Unencrypted remote login protocol. Transmits credentials and data in plaintext.
    remediation: Disable Telnet. Use SSH instead for secure remote access.
    ports:
      - <<: *insecure_on_default_port
        port: 23
      - *insecure_on_other_port

  - name: ftp
    severity: CRITICAL
    description: File Transfer Protocol. Transmits credentials and data in plaintext.
    remediation: Disable FTP. Use SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) for secure file transfers.
    ports:
      - <<: *insecure_on_default_port
        port: 21
      - *insecure_on_other_port

  - name: http
    severity: HIGH
    description: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Transmits data in plaintext.
    remediation: Use HTTPS (HTTP Secure, typically on port 443) for all web traffic to ensure encryption.
    ports:
      - <<: *insecure_on_default_port
        port: 80
      - *insecure_on_other_port

  - name: finger
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: User information protocol. Can expose sensitive user information.
    remediation: Disable this service unless absolutely necessary and understand the information exposure risks.
    ports:
      - <<: *insecure_on_default_port
        port: 79
      - *insecure_on_other_port

  - name: smtp
    severity: CRITICAL
    description: SMTP without TLS is unencrypted, highly vulnerable, and often blocked or used for spam relay.
    remediation: Use SMTPS (typically on port 465, Nmap service 'smtps') or SMTP with enforced STARTTLS (typically on port 587) for secure email transmission.
    ports:
      - <<: *insecure_on_default_port
        port: 25
      - <<: *insecure_on_default_port
        port: 587
      - <<: *insecure_on_other_port

  - name: pop3
    severity: CRITICAL
    description: Post Office Protocol version 3. Retrieves email, typically unencrypted in this form.
    remediation: Use POP3S (POP3 over SSL/TLS, typically on port 995) for encrypted email retrieval.
    ports:
      - <<: *insecure_on_default_port
        port: 110
      - <<: *insecure_on_other_port

  - name: imap 
    severity: CRITICAL
    description: Internet Message Access Protocol. Credentials and emails can be transmitted in plaintext.
    remediation: Use IMAPS (IMAP over SSL/TLS, typically on port 993) or IMAP with enforced STARTTLS for encrypted email access.
    ports:
      - <<: *insecure_on_default_port
        port: 143
      - <<: *insecure_on_other_port

  - name: ldap
    severity: CRITICAL
    description: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. Credentials and directory data can be transmitted in plaintext.
    remediation: Use LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS, typically on port 636) or LDAP with enforced STARTTLS for secure directory access.
    ports:
      - <<: *insecure_on_default_port
        port: 389 
      - <<: *insecure_on_other_port

  ## Services that have secure and insecure versions.
  - name: snmp
    severity: HIGH # Defaulting to HIGH as a precaution, as v1/v2c are common.
    description: Simple Network Management Protocol. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c are insecure due to plaintext community strings and lack of encryption. SNMPv3 offers security features.
    remediation: MUST use SNMPv3 with strong authentication (e.g., SHA) and privacy (e.g., AES) - 'authPriv' security level. Change default community strings if forced to use v1/v2c (not recommended). Use strong, unique community strings/credentials. Implement ACLs to restrict access to trusted management stations. Disable SNMP if not essential.
