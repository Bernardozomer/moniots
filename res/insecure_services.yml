  # Aliases.
  ## Used for services that are insecure by default, and their standard port is a common target.
  - &insecure_on_default_port
    note: This protocol/version is insecure. Its default port is well-known and frequently scanned by attackers.

  ## Used for services that are insecure by default, running on a non-standard port.
  - &insecure_on_other_port
    port: -1 # Represents any non-default port for this service.
    note: This protocol/version is insecure. Running on a non-default port offers minor obscurity but does not fix underlying security issues.

  ## Used for secure services whose default port is often targeted, and changing it is a common hardening recommendation.
  - &secure_on_default_port_change_recommended
    note: This protocol is secure, but its default port is heavily targeted.

  # Services.
  ## Secure services where changing the default port is often recommended.

    severity: MEDIUM
    description: Secure Shell. Encrypted remote login, file transfer (SFTP), and tunneling.
    cwe_ids: [] # SSH itself is secure; CWEs would apply to misconfigurations or vulnerable versions.
    remediation: This protocol is secure, but consider changing the default port as part of a defense-in-depth strategy.

  ## Services that have secure and insecure versions.
  - name: snmp
    severity: HIGH # Defaulting to HIGH as a precaution, as v1/v2c are common.

      - 287 # Improper Authentication
      - 200 # Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
      - 319 # Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (for v1/v2c data)
    remediation: MUST use SNMPv3 with strong authentication (e.g., SHA) and privacy (e.g., AES) - 'authPriv' security level. Change default community strings if forced to use v1/v2c (not recommended). Use strong, unique community strings/credentials. Implement ACLs to restrict access to trusted management stations. Disable SNMP if not essential.
